Hello dear reader !
In this repository you will find a funny banana themed project that 
contains 4 algorithms.
1. Digits of Pi : prints the digits of Pi which corresponds to the number of digits that the user introduces.

2. Digits of Euler : prints the digits of the Euler number which corresponds the number of digits that the user introduces.

3. Fibonacci: considering N to be the number introduced by the user, the algorithm prints the Nth numbers from the Fibonacci series.
